# Which is my wallet address used for creating my Aragon Govern?

The wallet address that has created the Aragon Govern can be read directly on the blockchain using the _DAO Govern Executor Address_ (you can find it in the _Settings_ of you Aragon Govern):

* Go in your DAO Govern - _Setting - DAO Govern Executor Address - copy the address._&#x20;

If your Dao is on Rinkeby go [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io) and paste the copied address in the search bar.

If you Dao is on Ethereum go [here](https://etherscan.io) and paste the copied address in the search bar.&#x20;

Go in the _transactions_ section list. Here you have one transaction, click on the _txn hash_. A new page (named _Transaction Details_) will be opened - the _from_ address __ is the address of your wallet address.
