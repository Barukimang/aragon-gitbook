# How to delete a DAO

The DAOs are deployed on the blockchain so they can't be deleted.&#x20;

The token of the DAO can be 'burned' however:

* If your DAO is on the **Ethereum** network you can send your tokens to this address: _**0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD**_ to 'burn' them.
* If your DAO is on the **Polygon** network you can send your tokens to this address: _**xxxxx**_ to 'burn' them.
* If your DAO is on the **Harmony** network you can send your tokens to this address: _**xxxxx**_ to burn them.
* If your DAO is on the **Metis Andromeda** network you can send your tokens to this address: _**xxxxx**_ to burn them.
