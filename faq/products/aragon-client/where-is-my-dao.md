# Where is my DAO?

You have deployed a DAO. Great! But you can't find it. Where is your DAO?&#x20;

Let's see how to access your DAO.

If the Dao creation process is well completed and the DAO was correctly deployed, you can access your DAO in an easy way.&#x20;

Copy and paste this URL to your browser:

[https://client.aragon.org/#/](https://client.aragon.org/#/) <_**DAO name**_>

Note: <_**DAO name**_> is the name of your DAO that you have chosen during the Dao creation phase.

Don't forget to connect your web3 wallet to the network (aka the network where you have deployed your Dao) and to select the right wallet address account.
