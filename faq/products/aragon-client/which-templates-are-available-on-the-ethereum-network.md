# Which templates are available on the Ethereum  Network?

On the Ethereum (Mainnet) Network can be deployed a DAO choosing one of these templates:

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Company Dao**</mark>: use **transferable tokens** to represent an ownership stake in your organization. Decisions are made based on **stake-weighted voting**.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Membership Dao**</mark>: use a **non-transferable token** to represent the membership. Decisions are made based on **one-member-one-vote** governance.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Reputation Dao**</mark>: use **non-transferable tokens** to represent reputation. Decisions are made using r**eputation-weighted voting**.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Open Enterprise Dao**</mark> (not maintained): a **suite of apps** for organizations, including **project management, bounties, budget planning** and **rewards**.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Dandelion Dao**</mark> (not maintained): **Facilitate collaboration** with an organization that makes it easy for contributors to simply part ways when disagreements occur.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Fundraising Dao**</mark> (not maintained): Launch a transparent and accountable **crowdfunding campaign** for your organization.

Note:  "_not maintained"_ indicates that the third part that as deployed the template doesn't longer support it. In the case of bugs may not be fixed.
