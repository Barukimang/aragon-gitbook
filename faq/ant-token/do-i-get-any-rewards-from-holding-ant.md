# Do I get any rewards from holding ANT?

ANT does not currently provide any direct staking rewards as a result of holding it. There are however indirect rewards that may be reflected in ANT's value. Given that the work token ANJ is bonded to ANT and Aragon Court offers staking rewards by way of subscription fees, dispute fees, and ruling fees, in absence of any other external factors and assuming perfect arbitrage, the valuation of ANT may change to reflect staking rewards earned by ANJ holders.
