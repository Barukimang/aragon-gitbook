# My wallet (with the ANJ or ANT v1) isn't available on the wallets list on the Aragon Portal.

If your wallet isn't available in the list of wallets on the Aragon Portal, you can choose a wallet on the list proposed on the Aragon Portal, you can create a new account and move the tokens from your wallet to the new wallet. Then proceed with the swap on the portal. Alternately you can import your seed into the new wallet, connect the new wallet to the portal and proceed with the swap.
