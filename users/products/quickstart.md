Where you can create your first DAO in a couple of clicks: manage your members, vote, admin your funds directly on the blockchain without a single line of code.
* [Aragon Govern](aragon-govern/): the **more advanced version** of our client. It is the next-generation solution for **building DAOs.** It was designed to provide even greater freedom of action, yet take a fraction of the time to deploy. It requires some technical background, yet has considerably more potential.&#x20;

The **voting** protocol **** that powers the platform is designed to be **universally verifiable, secure, and resistant to attack and censorship** through the use of blockchain technology, together with decentralized technologies and cryptographic mechanisms, such as zero-knowledge proofs.
