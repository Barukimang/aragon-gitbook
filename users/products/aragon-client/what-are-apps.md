# What are Apps?

As mentioned in the earlier section [Anatomy of an Aragon Client DAO](../../../developers/tools/the-basics/the-aragon-client/anatomy.md), Aragon organizations have the ability to extend their functionality using Aragon apps. The apps that come pre-installed with Company, Membership, and Reputation organizations are:

* Tokens
* Voting
* Finance
* Agent (optional)

There is a Marketplace where you can find more apps, such as Redemption, Payroll, Surveys.&#x20;

You can install multiple instances of any custom app, if this fits your use case.
