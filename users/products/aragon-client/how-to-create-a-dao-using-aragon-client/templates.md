# Templates

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn which are the templates available for creating a DAO and which are the main differences.
{% endhint %}

Templates are pre-configured smart contracts for different types of organizations. You can use the templates that are included with Aragon or [create your own](https://github.com/aragon/dao-templates).&#x20;

Aragon currently includes three templates:

* [Company](use-company-template.md)_: a_ _Company_ organization is an organization that uses **transferable tokens** to represent stake in the company. Decisions are made using **token-weighted voting**, where one token equals one vote.
* [Membership](use-membership-template.md): a _Membership_ organization is an organization that uses a **non-transferable token** to represent membership. Decisions are made based on **one-member-one-vote** governance.
* [Reputation](page-1.md): a _Reputation_ organization is an organization that uses **non-transferable tokens** to represent reputation. Decisions are made using **reputation-weighted voting**.

This section will walk you through examples of how you can use these templates as a starting point for your organization.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Note: If the default templates don't give you exactly what you want for your organization, you can set up a_ [_development environment_](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started#environment-setup) _and use the_ [_aragonCLI_](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro) _to_ [_create a custom organization_](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/guides-custom-deploy)_._
