# Finance App

The Finance app is used to manage the financial resources of an organization. You can see the balance of each asset the organization owns, a history of past transfers, and also create new transfers from the Finance app.

[**3.4.2 Transfers**](broken-reference/)

The Transfers section shows you a history of past transfers that have been made using the Finance app, including information about the date of the transfer, what address the transfer was to or from, a reference with additional context about the transfer, and the amount of the transfer.

The transfer history can be filtered by date:

For each transfer, you can click on the drop down menu to get a link to view the transaction on the blockchain so you can see even more detail about the transfer:

And if you need to export your transfer history for accounting in a separate app, there's an export button that you can use to export a CSV file:

## <mark style="color:purple;">**3.4.3 New Transfer**</mark>

To send funds to your organization, you can create a deposit using the Finance app. Click the "New Transfer" button, open the "Deposit" tab, select the token you want to deposit, enter the amount and an optional reference note, then click the "Submit deposit" button.

_Note: For non-ETH tokens, two transactions may be required to make a deposit. The first transaction approves the Finance app to pull the deposit amount from your account balance, and the second transaction is the actual deposit transaction. This is a safety feature to prevent the Finance app from pulling more funds from your account than you have explicitly authorized._\\

To create a new transfer from your organization to another address, you can create a withdrawal using the Finance app. Click the “New Transfer” button, open the "Withdrawal" tab, then enter the address you want to make the transfer to, what token you want to send, and the amount of tokens you want to send. You can optionally add a reference note to provide more context for the transfer. Once you have filled out all of this information you can click the “Submit transfer” button to complete the action, if you have permission.
