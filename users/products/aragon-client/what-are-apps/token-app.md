# Token App

The Tokens app is used to **manage membership** and **voting power** in an organization. To add members to an organization, it’s as easy as minting and assigning a token to them.

On the Company template, one token equals one vote, members can hold as many tokens as are assigned to them, and tokens are transferable.&#x20;

With the Membership template, one token also equals one vote, but members cannot hold more than one token each and tokens are non-transferable.&#x20;

Regarding the Reputation template, one token equals one vote, and members can hold as many tokens as are assigned to them, but the tokens are non-transferable.

This simple process for managing membership and voting power provides the foundation for governing the resources of an organization using Aragon.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Holder**</mark>

In the _Holder_ section of the _Tokens_ app, you can see the current list of token holders and the balance of organization tokens they each hold.&#x20;

Clicking on the dropdown menu on one of the rows in the list will provide you options for:

* assigning more tokens to that token holder (_Add tokens_ option)&#x20;
* removing tokens from the token holder (_Remove tokens_ option)
* editing a custom label (for more about this go [here](../home.md))

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Token Info**</mark>

In the _Token Info_ section you can see information about the token that is used for governance in your organization:

* _Token supply_: how many tokens have been minted in total
* _Transferable_: whether or not the token can be transferred to another entity after it has been assigned
* _Token_: the token name and token symbol

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Ownership Distribution**</mark>

In the _Ownership Distribution_ section, you can see which entities own what percent of the organization’s token supply. This can be helpful as a spot check to see how token ownership is concentrated in the organization.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Add Tokens**</mark>

If you need to add members to your organization and assign them DAO tokens, you need to use the _Add Token_ option.

If you click the _Add Tokens_ button, a panel will open up with text fields for entering:

* the _recipient_: the address of the entity you want to assign tokens to&#x20;
* _number of tokens_: how many tokens you want to assign.&#x20;

After you enter this information, you can click the _Add tokens_ button in the panel to finish completing the action.
