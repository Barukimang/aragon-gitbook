# Templates

Templates are pre-configured smart contracts for different types of organizations. You can use the templates that are included with Aragon or [create your own](https://github.com/aragon/dao-templates).

Aragon currently includes three templates:

* [Company](https://help.aragon.org/article/30-create-a-new-company-organization)
* [Membership](https://help.aragon.org/article/34-create-a-new-membership-organization)
* [Reputation](https://help.aragon.org/article/32-create-a-new-reputation-organization)

This section will walk you through examples of how you can use these templates as a starting point for your organization.

_Note: If the default templates don't give you exactly what you want for your organization, you can set up a_ [_development environment_](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started#environment-setup) _and use the_ [_aragonCLI_](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro) _to_ [_create a custom organization_](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/guides-custom-deploy)_._
