# About Aragon Client

**Aragon Client** (regarded as Aragon v1) is the first generation protocol to create DAOs. Is a thoroughly tested toolkit that has been used for the past 3 years. Launched in 2019, it became the dominant solution on the market. You can check the organizations powered by Aragon [here](https://poweredby.aragon.org).

It has a modular structure, which is great if you are just starting out with a DAO creation.  It allows you to play around with adding more apps and functionalities through the easy UI.

Aragon is looking to replace **Aragon Client** (v1) with a new and better **Aragon Govern** (v2) tool.&#x20;
