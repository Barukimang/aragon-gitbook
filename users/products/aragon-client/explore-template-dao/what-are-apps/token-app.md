# Tokens App

The Tokens app is used to **mint new tokens** and **assign** them to yourself or other entities. Tokens minted by the Tokens app **confer voting abilities** to holders of the tokens.

There are many reasons an organization might mint tokens for entities. Here are a few examples:

* The organization commits to giving its workers a stake in the company e.g. half of the company tokens are held by workers and the other half by investors .
* The organization mints tokens to entities proportional to the amount of funds they have invested in the company.
* The organization mints a specific amount of tokens for an entity in exchange for a specific good or service .
* The organization mints a fixed amount of tokens per month and distributes them proportionally to everyone who has contributed value to the organization that month.

The Tokens app is used to **manage membership** and **voting power** in an organization. To add members to an organization, itâ€™s as easy as minting and assigning a token to them.

On the Company template, one token equals one vote, members can hold as many tokens as are assigned to them, and tokens are transferable.&#x20;

With the Membership template, one token also equals one vote, but members cannot hold more than one token each and tokens are non-transferable.&#x20;

Regarding the Reputation template, one token equals one vote, and members can hold as many tokens as are assigned to them, but the tokens are non-transferable.

This simple process for managing membership and voting power provides the foundation for governing the resources of an organization using Aragon.

## **Holder**

In the _Holder_ section of the _Tokens_ app, you can see the current list of token holders and the balance of organization tokens they each hold.&#x20;

Clicking on the dropdown menu on one of the rows in the list will provide you options for:

* Assigning more tokens to that token holder (_Add tokens_ option).&#x20;
* Removing tokens from the token holder (_Remove tokens_ option).
* Editing a custom label (for more about this go [here](../home.md)).

## **Token Info**

In the _Token Info_ section you can see information about the token that is used for governance in your organization:

* _Token supply_: how many tokens have been minted in total
* _Transferable_: whether or not the token can be transferred to another entity after it has been assigned.
* _Token_: the token name and token symbol.

## **Ownership Distribution**

In the _Ownership Distribution_ section, you can see which entities own what percent of the organizationâ€™s token supply. This can be helpful as a spot check to see how token ownership is concentrated in the organization.

## **Add Tokens**

If you need to add members to your organization and assign them DAO tokens, you need to use the _Add Token_ option.

If you click the _Add Tokens_ button, a panel will open up with text fields for entering:

* The _recipient_: the address of the entity you want to assign tokens to.&#x20;
* _Number of tokens_: how many tokens you want to assign.&#x20;

After you enter this information, you can click the _Add tokens_ button in the panel to finish completing the action.

At this point, the organization still requires a tokenholder vote for every action. Click _Create transaction_ to create the transaction that creates a **new vote** to assign the new token you want to mint. Sign the transaction in your Ethereum provider, wait for a confirmation, then move on to the next step.

### **Vote "Yes" to approve the "Assign Tokens" vote **<mark style="color:blue;">****</mark>&#x20;

Go to the Voting app, click on the _Mint tokens_ proposal you just created, and vote "Yes" to approve minting and assigning the token.

### **Check out the newest member of your organization**

Your organization just went from one to two members. A good start to a new Company organization!

Note: If a vote is cast that causes the Approval % to be equal to or greater than the Support required (e.g. 60% required Support with current 65% Approval), then the proposition will be completed automatically. If the Approval % is less than the Support required (e.g. 60% required Support with current 40% Approval) then additional "no" votes could still stop the proposition from being passed. Thus the proposition will remain open until either the duration is reached or the  Approval % is equal to or greater than the Support requirement.&#x20;
