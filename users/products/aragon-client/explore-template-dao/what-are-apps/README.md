{% endhint %}

Aragon organizations have the ability to extend their functionality using Aragon apps. The apps that come pre-installed with the Company, Membership, and Reputation organizations are:

* Tokens
* Voting
* Finance
* Agent (optional)

There is a Marketplace where you can find more apps, such as Redemption, Payroll, Surveys.&#x20;

You can install multiple instances of any [custom app](../../../../../developers/tools/guides/your-first-aragon-app.md), if this fits your use case.
