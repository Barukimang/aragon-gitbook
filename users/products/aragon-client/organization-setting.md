# Organization Setting

The Organization page has information about your organization, including the addresses of the installed apps. Each of these apps is a separate smart contract, and you can use this address to directly interact with them.

If you are using Aragon on testnet, you can also request test tokens from the Organization page. After confirmation, the test tokens will be available to transfer from the Finance app.

_Note: Do not send any tokens to your organization's app addresses. If you want to send tokens to your organization, you should follow the instructions for_ [_making a deposit_](https://aragon.helpscoutdocs.com/article/20-finance#new)_._\
