# Getting started with Ethereum

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn how to connect and use your web3 wallet on the Ethereum network (aka Mainnet).
{% endhint %}

## **Connect your web3 wallet to the Ethereum network**

We recommend using [MetaMask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

_Login_ to your wallet and select the _Ethereum Mainnet_ on the drop-down _Networks_ menu. The Ethereum Network is already set up on your metamask wallet.

&#x20;

## **Deposit at least 0.2 ETH to your Ethereum wallet.**

Now you need to load your wallet with enough ether (abbreviated as **ETH**) to pay for gas. Each transaction on the network requests a gas fee pay. For example the transfer of funds from your wallet, the deployment of your organization,  the interactions within your organization.&#x20;

$ETH is a cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum network and can be acquired from any [cryptocurrency exchange that lists ETH](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/how-to-buy-ether/).&#x20;

**How much $ETH are necessary for deploying a DAO?**&#x20;

As a rough estimate of how much ETH you will need, multiply the [current “standard” gas price in gwei](https://ethgasstation.info) by 0.02.&#x20;

For example: at a standard gas price of 10 gwei, you should have 0.2 ETH in your wallet. You can estimate the necessary gas price [here](gas-tracker.md).
