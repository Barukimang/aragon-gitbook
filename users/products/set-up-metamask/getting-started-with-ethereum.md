# Getting started with Ethereum

**Connect your Web3 wallet to the Ethereum network.**

We recommend using MetaMask as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

Login to your wallet and select the _Ethereum Mainnet_ on the drop-down _Networks_ menu. The Ethereum Network is already set up on your metamask wallet.

**Deposit at least 0.2 $ETH to your Ethereum wallet.**

You will then need to load your wallet with enough ether (abbreviated as "**ETH**") to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization.&#x20;

ETH is a cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum network and can be acquired from any [cryptocurrency exchange that lists ETH](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/how-to-buy-ether/).&#x20;

As a rough estimate of how much ETH you will need, multiply the [current “standard” gas price in gwei](https://ethgasstation.info) by 0.02. For example, at a standard gas price of 10 gwei, you should have 0.2 ETH in your wallet.
