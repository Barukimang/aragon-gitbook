&#x20;In this section, we'll go through how to import the seed of a wallet into the Metamask wallet.
{% endhint %}

The first step is to open up the Metamask browser extension and to login. If you're using Chrome you should be able to open Metamask by clicking on the fox icon located to the right of your address bar (see image below).&#x20;

If you can't see it, [click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/metamask). This will open up an interface to your Ethereum wallet.

Now click on _Import using account seed phrase_. Metamask should now open up in a new tab, with the heading: _Restore your account with Seed Phrase_.

Importing the 12 words phrase will allow you to use Metamask with your wallet.

Once you copied the 12 word seed phrase, paste it into the wallet seed text box, and create a new password (see image below).
