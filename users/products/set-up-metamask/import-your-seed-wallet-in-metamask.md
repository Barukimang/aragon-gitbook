# Import your seed wallet in metamask

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;In this section, we'll go through how to import the seed of a wallet into metamask wallet.
{% endhint %}

The first step is to open up the Metamask browser extension and login. If you're using Chrome you should be able to do this by clicking on the fox icon located to the right of your address bar.&#x20;

If you can't see it, [click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/metamask). This will open up an interface to your Ethereum wallet.

Click on _the circle_ in the top right. You should see a black drop down menu appear.

Click on the _Log out_ button in the top right of this menu. You'll be taken to a _Welcome Back_ page.

Now click on _Import using account seed phrase_. Metamask should now open up in a new tab, with the heading: _Restore your account with Seed Phrase_.

Import the 12 words phrase (this will allow us to use MetaMask with your account).

Note that your mnemonic phrase won't be the same as mine. So make sure you copy yours from your terminal, and not from this blog.
{% endhint %}

Once you've copied the 12 words, create a new password.

When you're done, click on the _Restore_ button at the bottom of the page.&#x20;

The imported account will appear in the _My account list_ on the _circle_ in the top right on metamask. &#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations ðŸŽ‰. You've now connected MetaMask to an Ethereum account.&#x20;
