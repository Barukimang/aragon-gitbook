{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;In this section, we'll go through how to import the seed of a wallet into metamask wallet.
{% endhint %}

The first step is to open up the Metamask browser extension and login. If you're using Chrome you should be able to do this by clicking on the fox icon located to the right of your address bar.&#x20;

If you can't see it, [click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/metamask). This will open up an interface to your Ethereum wallet. Set up your wallet as described [here](./).

Now click on **Import using account seed phrase**. Metamask should now open up in a new tab, with the heading: **Restore your account with Seed Phrase**.

Import the 12 words phrase will allow us to use MetaMask with your account.

> Note that your mnemonic phrase won't be the same as mine. So make sure you copy yours from your terminal, and not from this blog.

Once you've copied it, paste it into the wallet seed text box, and create a new password.
