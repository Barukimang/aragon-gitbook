## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Mumbai Testnet**

We recommend using [Metamask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

* _Login_ to your wallet (Metamask in our example)&#x20;
* Go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) site
* In the search box insert: _mumbai_
* Click the _connect your wallet_ button on the top right (if Metamask is well connected the fox icon appears)
* And click _add to Metamask_ button_._

## **Deposit TEST MATIC to your Mumbai wallet**

TEST MATIC token is the test-MATIC used on Mumbai to pay for transaction fees (abbreviated as MATIC) and, consequently, for deploying a DAO, in the same way that test-ETH is used on Rinkeby.&#x20;

> Important info: please note that the symbol of the test-MATIC is "MATIC", the same as for mainnet-matic.

To get test-MATIC, you can go to the [Polygon Mumbai Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology):&#x20;

* Network: select _Mumbai_,&#x20;
* Select token: choose _MATIC Token_,&#x20;
* Wallet address: enter your wallet address where you will receive the test-Matic (if you are using Metamask, it is your wallet account address)
* Click _Submit_&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
It may take some time to receive your test-MATIC due to network traffic. At the time of writing this, it took around 30 minutes. You should see test-MATIC in your wallet (in our example, Metamask account) soon after!
