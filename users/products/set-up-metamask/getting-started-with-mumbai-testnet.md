## **Deposit test-MATIC to your Mumbai wallet**

### What is test-MATIC?

TEST MATIC token is the test-MATIC used on Mumbai to pay for transaction fees (abbreviated as MATIC) and, consequently, for deploying a DAO, in the same way that test-ETH is used on Rinkeby.&#x20;

> Important info: please note that the symbol of the test-MATIC is "MATIC", the same as for mainnet-matic.

### How to get test-MATIC?

To get test-MATIC, you can go to the [Polygon Mumbai Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology):&#x20;

* Network select _**Mumbai**_,&#x20;
* Select token _**MATIC Token**_,&#x20;
* Enter your wallet address where you will receive the test-Matic&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are using Metamask, it is your wallet account address.
{% endhint %}

* Click _**Submit**_&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
It may take even up to 30 minutes to receive your test-MATIC due to network traffic. You should see test-MATIC in your wallet (in our example, Metamask account) soon after.
