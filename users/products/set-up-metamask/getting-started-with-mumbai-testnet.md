{% endhint %}

## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Mumbai testnet**

We recommend using [MetaMask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

* _Login_ to your wallet (metamask in our example)&#x20;
* go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) site
* in the search box insert _mumbai_
* click the _connect your wallet_ button on the top right (if metamask is well connected the fox icon appears)
* and click _add to metamask_ button_._

## **Deposit TEST MATIC to your Mumbai wallet**

TEST MATIC  token is the test-MATIC used on Mumbai to pay for transaction fees (abbreviated as MATIC\*) and, consequently, for deploying a DAO, in the same way that test-ETH is used on Rinkeby.&#x20;

> \*Important info: Please note that the symbol of the test-MATIC is "MATIC", the same as for the matic.

To get test-MATIC, you can go to the [Polygon Mumbai Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology):&#x20;

* _Network_: select _Mumbai_,&#x20;
* _Select token_: choose _MATIC Token_,&#x20;
* _Wallet address_: enter your wallet address where you will receive the test-Matic (if you are using metamask, it is your wallet account address)
* click _Submit_&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
It may take some time to receive your test-MATIC due to network traffic. At the time of writing this, it took around 30 minutes. You should see test-MATIC in your wallet (in our example, Metamask account) soon after!
