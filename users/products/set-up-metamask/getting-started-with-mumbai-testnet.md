# Getting started with Mumbai testnet

**Connect your Web3 wallet to the Mumbai testnet.**

We recommend using MetaMask as your Web3 wallet. Login to your wallet.&#x20;

Go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) - insert _mumbai_ in the search box - _connect your wallet_ and _add to metamask._ &#x20;

**Deposit $MATIC TEST token to your Mumbai wallet.**

$MATIC TEST token is the "test" MATIC used on Mumbai to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, for deploying a DAO, in the same way that "test" $ETH is used on Rinkeby.&#x20;

To get "test" MATIC, you can go to the [Polygon Mumbai Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology): select Network "Mumbai", choose "MATIC Token", and enter your Mumbai wallet address, then click “Submit.”&#x20;

It may take some time to receive your "test" MATIC due to network traffic. (At the time of writing this, it took around 30 minutes.) You should see "test" MATIC in your Metamask account soon after!
