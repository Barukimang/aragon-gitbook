# Getting started with Rinkeby testnet

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn how to connect and use your web3 wallet on the Rinkeby testnet.
{% endhint %}

## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Rinkeby testnet**

We recommend using [MetaMask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

_Login_ to your wallet and select the _Rinkeby Test Network_ on the drop-down _Networks_ menu. The Rinkeby Network is already set up on your metamask wallet.

## **Deposit TEST ETH to your Rinkeby wallet**

Now you need to load your wallet with enough test-ether (abbreviated as **ETH**\*) to pay for gas. Each transaction on the network requests a gas fee pay. For example the transfer of funds from your wallet, the deployment of your organization,  the interactions within your organization. &#x20;

> \*Important info: Please note that the symbol of the test-ether is "ETH", the same as for the ether.

You can claim TEST ETH on the Rinkeby Faucet:&#x20;
