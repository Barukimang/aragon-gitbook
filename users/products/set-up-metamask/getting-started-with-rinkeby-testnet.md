# Getting started with Rinkeby testnet

**Connect your Web3 wallet to the Rinkeby testnet.**

We recommend using MetaMask as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

Login to your wallet and select the _Rinkeby Test Network_ on the drop-down _Networks_ menu. The Rinkeby Network is already set up on your metamask wallet.

**Deposit $ETH TEST token to your Rinkeby wallet.**

You will then need to load your wallet with enough test-ether (abbreviated as "**ETH**" \*) to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization.&#x20;
