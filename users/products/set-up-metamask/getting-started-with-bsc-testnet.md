{% endhint %}

## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the BSC testnet**

We recommend using [MetaMask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

* _Login_ to your wallet (metamask in our example)&#x20;
* go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) site
* in the search box insert _binance smart chain testnet_
* click the _connect your wallet_ button on the top right (if metamask is well connected the fox icon appears)
* and click _add to metamask_ button_._

![Add the BSC testnet to metamask using chainlist.org](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Schermata 2022-01-26 alle 23.31.24.png>)

## **Deposit TEST BNB token to your BSC Testnet wallet**

You will then need to load your wallet with enough test-BNB (abbreviated as "BNB" \*) to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization.&#x20;

> \*Important info: Please note that the symbol of the test-BNB is "BNB", the same as for the BNB.

You can try the [Binance Smart Chain faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart) or post your BSC testnet address in the [Aragon Chat #support-community](https://discordapp.com/channels/672466989217873929/694844628586856469) to receive test-BSC for free.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you post your faucet request in an Aragon Chat channel, please be patient and wait. We will send them to you.
