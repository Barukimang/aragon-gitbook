# Getting started with BSC Testnet

**Connect your Web3 wallet to the BSC testnet.**

We recommend using MetaMask as your Web3 wallet. Login to your wallet.&#x20;

Go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) - insert _binance smart chain testnet_ in the search box - _connect your wallet_ and _add to metamask._

**Deposit $BNB TEST token to your BSC Testnet wallet.**

You will then need to load your wallet with enough test-BNB (abbreviated as "BNB" \*) to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization.&#x20;

You can try the [Binance Smart Chain faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart) or post your BSC testnet address in the [Aragon Chat #support-community](https://discordapp.com/channels/672466989217873929/694844628586856469) to receive test-BSC for free. Please wait if you post your faucet request in an Aragon Chat channel.

\*Please note that the symbol of the test-BNB is "BNB", the same as for the BNB.
