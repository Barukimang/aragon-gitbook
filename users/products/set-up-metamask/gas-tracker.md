# Gas Tracker

Your Ethereum provider (also called Metamask) _should_ pre-fill the correct gas limit and gas price, but sometimes it will pre-fill the amounts too low which causes transactions to execute very slow or even not at all.

You can check yourself which is the best gas price to set and adjust it in the transaction settings of your wallet during the transaction approval process:

* Polygon network - [https://polygonscan.com/gastracker](https://polygonscan.com/gastracker)
* Harmony network - not yet available
* Metis Andromeda network - not yet available

Here you can find how to adjust the gas price in Metamask for a transaction: [https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022895972-Using-advanced-gas-controls](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022895972-Using-advanced-gas-controls)
