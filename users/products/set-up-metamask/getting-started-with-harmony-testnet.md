## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Harmony testnet**

We recommend using [MetaMask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

* _Login_ to your wallet (metamask in our example)&#x20;
* go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) site
* in the search box insert _harmony testnet shard 0_
* click the _connect your wallet_ button on the top right (if metamask is well connected the fox icon appears)
* and click _add to metamask_ button_._   &#x20;

![Add the Harmony testnet to metamask using chainlist.org](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Schermata 2022-01-26 alle 23.28.07.png>)

## **Deposit TEST-ONE to your Harmony test wallet**

Get your Harmony One address for the faucet:

* go to [https://explorer.harmony.one/](https://explorer.harmony.one)&#x20;
* copy the account address from your metamask wallet and paste it into the search bar
* It should output an address that begins with _one1_.

You'll need to copy that address and then go to [https://faucet.pops.one/](https://faucet.pops.one) and insert your address.
