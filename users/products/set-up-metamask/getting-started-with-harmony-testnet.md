{% endhint %}

## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Harmony Testnet**

We recommend using [Metamask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

* Login to your wallet (Metamask in our example)&#x20;
* Go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) site
* In the search box insert _harmony testnet shard 0_
* Click the _connect your wallet_ button on the top right (if Metamask is well connected the fox icon appears)
* And click _add to Metamask_ button_._   &#x20;

## **Deposit TEST-ONE to your Harmony test wallet**

TEST ONE token is the test-ONE used on Harmony Testnet to pay for transaction fees (abbreviated as ONE) and, consequently, to deploy a DAO, in the same way, that test-ETH is used on Rinkeby.

> Important info: Please note that the symbol of the test-ONE is "ONE", the same as for mainnet-ONE.

Get your Harmony One address for the faucet:

* Go to [https://explorer.harmony.one/](https://explorer.harmony.one)&#x20;
* Copy the account address from your Metamask wallet and paste it into the search bar
* It should output an address that begins with _one1_

You will need to copy that address and then go to [https://faucet.pops.one/](https://faucet.pops.one) and insert your address.

> Wait a couple of seconds and look forward to receiving 1000 Test One... enough to make DAOs for all your frens'n'fam :sunglasses:.
