# Getting started with Harmony testnet

**Connect your Web3 wallet to the Rinkeby testnet.**

We recommend using MetaMask as your Web3 wallet. Login to your wallet.&#x20;

Go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) - insert _harmony testnet_ in the search box - _connect your wallet_ and _add to metamask._ &#x20;

**Deposit $ONE TEST to your Harmony test wallet.**

Get your Harmony One address for the faucet - go to [https://explorer.harmony.one/](https://explorer.harmony.one) and copy the ID from your metamask wallet.

It should output an address that begins with one1.... you'll need to copy that address and then go to [https://faucet.pops.one/](https://faucet.pops.one) and insert your address - wait a couple of seconds and look forward to having 1000 Test One..... enough to make DAOs for all your frens'n'fam.
