**Deposit $METIS TEST token to your Stardust wallet.**

$METIS TEST token is the "test" METIS used on Stardust to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, for deploying a DAO, in the same way, that "test" $ETH is used on Rinkeby.&#x20;

How to get $METIS TEST tokens:

1. **Switch to the Rinkeby test network on your Metamask**
2.  **Import Token:**&#x20;

    You would need to import the Metis token. Click on the _Import Token_ option on Metamask and input the Metis token address `0xe552fb52a4f19e44ef5a967632dbc320b0820639`

    You would then see your Metis token balance.
3.  **Get Rinkeby ether**

    This step is applicable if you do not have any tokens at all or if you have a fresh account with 0 Metis balance. If you need same Rinkeby "ETH test go [here](getting-started-with-rinkeby-testnet.md).&#x20;
4.  **Get Metis on Rinkeby**

    Head over to [https://rinkeby-faucet.metis.io/](https://rinkeby-faucet.metis.io) and make sure your account is connected.

    Confirm the transaction and wait it is completed. Thatâ€™s it! Once all instructions are followed, you will receive a success message that the transaction was successful and your wallet was updated.
5.  **Transfer tokens from L1 (layer 1) to L2 (layer 2)**

    Go to the [bridge](https://bridge.metis.io) to transfer tokens from L1 to L2. Select the Rinkeby Testnet network on your metamask wallet. Select deposit, select metis and insert the amount as showed in the image. Confirm the transactions and wait. Select the Metis Stardust Network on your metamask wallet for seeing your $METIS TEST ready for use.
