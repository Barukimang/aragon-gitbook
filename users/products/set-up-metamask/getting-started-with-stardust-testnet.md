## **Deposit TEST METIS token to your Stardust wallet**

$METIS TEST token is the test-METIS used on Stardust to pay for transaction fees (abbreviated as "METIS") and, consequently, to deploy a DAO, in the same way, that test-ETH is used on Rinkeby.&#x20;

> Important info: Please note that the symbol of the test-METIS is "METIS", the same as for the mainnet-METIS.

How to get TEST-METIS tokens:

1. **Switch to the Rinkeby test network on your Metamask**
2.  **Import Token:**&#x20;

    You will need to import the Metis token. Click on the _Import Token_ option on Metamask and input the Metis token address `0xe552fb52a4f19e44ef5a967632dbc320b0820639`

    You will then see your Metis token balance.
3.  **Get Rinkeby ether**

    This step is applicable if you do not have any tokens at all or if you have a fresh account with 0 Metis balance. If you need some Rinkeby test "ETH" go [here](getting-started-with-rinkeby-testnet.md).&#x20;
4.  **Get Metis on Rinkeby**

    Head over to [https://rinkeby-faucet.metis.io/](https://rinkeby-faucet.metis.io) and make sure your account is connected.

    Confirm the transaction and wait until it is completed. Thatâ€™s it! Once all instructions are followed, you will receive a success message that the transaction was successful and your wallet was updated.
5.  **Transfer tokens from L1 (layer 1) to L2 (layer 2)**

    Go to the [bridge](https://bridge.metis.io) to transfer tokens from L1 to L2. Select the Rinkeby Testnet network in your Metamask wallet. Select deposit, select Metis and insert the amount as shown in the image below. Confirm the transactions and wait. Select the Metis Stardust Network in your Metamask wallet for seeing your test-METIS ($METIS) ready for use.
