# Getting started with Harmony

{% hint style="info" %}
Important info: this note needs to be highlighted
{% endhint %}

**Connect your Web3 wallet to the Harmony network.**

We recommend using MetaMask as your Web3 wallet. Login to your wallet.&#x20;

Go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) - insert _harmony mainnet shard 0_ in the search box - _connect your wallet_ and _add to metamask._ &#x20;

**Deposit at least 0.2 $ONE to your Harmony wallet.**

$ONE is the currency used on Harmony to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, for deploying a DAO, in the same way that $ETH is used on Ethereum.

At least 0.2 $ONE is required to deploy an Aragon DAO, though the actual cost might be much less.

$ONE may be acquired on metamask through their 'bridge'  [https://bridge.harmony.one/busd](https://bridge.harmony.one/busd).&#x20;

An alternative bridge is [here](https://synapseprotocol.com/?inputCurrency=USDT\&outputCurrency=USDC\&outputChain=1666600000).
