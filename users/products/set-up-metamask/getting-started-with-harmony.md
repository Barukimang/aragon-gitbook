# Getting started with Harmony

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn how to connect and use your Web3 wallet on the Harmony network.
{% endhint %}

## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Harmony network**

We recommend using [Metamask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

* Login to your wallet (Metamask in our example)&#x20;
* Go to the [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) site
* In the search box insert _harmony mainnet shard 0_
* Click the _connect your wallet_ button on the top right (if Metamask is well connected the fox icon appears)
* And click _add to Metamask_ button_._ &#x20;

![Add the Harmony network to Metamask using chainlist.org](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Schermata 2022-01-26 alle 23.25.48.png>)

## **Deposit at least 0.2 ONE to your Harmony wallet**

ONE is the currency used on Harmony to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, to deploy a DAO, in the same way that ETH is used on Ethereum.

$ONE needs to be transferred onto the Polygon network using a 'bridge' such as [https://bridge.harmony.one/busd](https://bridge.harmony.one/busd). An alternative bridge can be found [here](https://synapseprotocol.com/?inputCurrency=USDT\&outputCurrency=USDC\&outputChain=1666600000).

**How much $ONE is necessary to deploy a DAO?**&#x20;

At least 0.2 $ONE is required to deploy an Aragon DAO, though the actual cost might be much less.
