# Getting started with Metis Andromeda

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn how to connect and use your web3 wallet on the Metis Andromeda network.
{% endhint %}

## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Andromeda network**

We recommend using [MetaMask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

* _Login_ to your wallet (metamask in our example)&#x20;
* go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) site
* in the search box insert _andromeda_
* click the _connect your wallet_ button on the top right (if metamask is well connected the fox icon appears)
* and click _add to metamask_ button_._

## **Deposit at least 0.2 METIS to your Andromeda wallet**

$METIS is the currency used on Andromeda to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, for deploying a DAO, in the same way that $ETH is used on Ethereum.

$METIS may be acquired on metamask through their 'bridge' [here.](https://bridge.metis.io/home) The bridge allows you to bring the $METIS from the Ethereum network to $METIS on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.

**How much $METIS are necessary for deploying a DAO?**&#x20;

At least 0.2 $METIS is required to deploy an Aragon DAO, though the actual cost might be much less.
