## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Andromeda network**

We recommend using [Metamask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

* Login to your wallet (Metamask in our example)&#x20;
* Go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) site
* In the search box insert _andromeda_
* Click the _connect your wallet_ button on the top right (if Metamask is well connected the fox icon appears)
* And click _add to Metamask_ button_._

## **Deposit at least 0.2 METIS to your Andromeda wallet**

$METIS is the currency used on Andromeda to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, to deploy a DAO, in the same way that $ETH is used on Ethereum.

$METIS needs to be transferred onto the Andromeda network using a 'bridge' such as this bridge [here.](https://bridge.metis.io/home) It allows you to bring the $METIS from the Ethereum network to $METIS on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.

**How much $METIS is necessary to deploy a DAO?**&#x20;

At least 0.2 $METIS is required to deploy an Aragon DAO, though the actual cost might be much less.
