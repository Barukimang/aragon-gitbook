**Deposit at least 0.2 $METIS to your Andromeda wallet.**

$METIS is the currency used on Andromeda to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, for deploying a DAO, in the same way that $ETH is used on Ethereum.

At least 0.2 $METIS is required to deploy an Aragon DAO, though the actual cost might be much less.

$METIS may be acquired on metamask through their 'bridge' [here.](https://bridge.metis.io/home) The bridge allows you to bring the $METIS from the Ethereum network to $METIS on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.
