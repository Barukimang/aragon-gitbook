# Getting started with Polygon

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn how to connect and use your Web3 wallet on the Polygon network.
{% endhint %}

## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Polygon network**

We recommend using [Metamask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.&#x20;

* _Login_ to your wallet (Metamask in our example)&#x20;
* Go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) site
* In the search box insert: _polygon mainnet_
* Click the _connect your wallet_ button on the top right (if Metamask is well connected the fox icon appears)
* And click _add to Metamask_ button_._ &#x20;

## **Deposit at least 0.2 MATIC to your Polygon wallet.**

$MATIC is the currency used on Polygon to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, for deploying a DAO, in the same way that ETH is used on Ethereum.

$MATIC can be bought on a decentralized exchange such as [UniSwap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap), using $ETH or any other ERC20 token. Then $MATIC needs to be transferred onto the Polygon network using a 'bridge' such as [https://wallet.matic.network/bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge).&#x20;

Alternatively, $MATIC can be bought from a centralized exchange, such as Binance or Kucoin and then sent directly to your Polygon wallet.

**How much $MATIC is necessary to deploy a DAO?**&#x20;

At least 0.2 $MATIC is required to deploy an Aragon DAO, though the actual cost might be more or less (depending on the network traffic). You can estimate the necessary gas price [here](gas-tracker.md).
