# Getting started with Polygon

**Connect your Web3 wallet to the Polygon network.**&#x20;

We recommend using MetaMask as your Web3 wallet. Login to your wallet.&#x20;

Go to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org) - insert _polygon mainnet_ in the search box - _connect your wallet_ and _add to metamask._ &#x20;

**Deposit at least 0.2 $MATIC to your Polygon wallet.**

$MATIC is the currency used on Polygon to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, for deploying a DAO, in the same way that $ETH is used on Ethereum.

At least 0.2 $MATIC is required to deploy an Aragon DAO, though the actual cost might be much less.

$MATIC may be bought on a decentralized exchange such as [UniSwap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap), using $ETH or any other ERC20 token. That $MATIC will then need to be transferred onto the Polygon network using a 'bridge' such as [https://wallet.matic.network/bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge). Alternatively, $MATIC may be bought from a centralized exchange, such as Binance or Kucoin and then sent directly to your Polygon wallet.
