# Sign a transaction with Metamask

{% hint style="info" %}
Important info: In this section, we'll go through how to sign your first transaction in your DAO using Metamask.
{% endhint %}

The first step is to open up the Metamask browser extension and login. If you are using Chrome you should be able to do this by clicking on the fox icon located to the right of your address bar.

If you can't see it, [click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/metamask). This will open up an interface to your Ethereum wallet. Set up your wallet as described [here](./).

In the Metamask wallet, select the network and the account you want to use. Access your DAO, connect your Metamask wallet, and interact to the DAO with an action.&#x20;

In the following example, we will add a new token and we will show how to sign the transaction to finalize this. If you need help on "How to add tokens to your Dao" please go [here](../aragon-client/explore-template-dao/what-are-apps/token-app.md).&#x20;

After filling in all the requested fields in the _Add tokens_ page and clicking the _Create transaction_ button, it opens a Metamask popup (as shown in the image below) which requests to sign the transaction with the _Confirm_ button. Confirm and that's it. The transaction is done. :tada:
