# Sign a transaction with MetaMask

In this section, we'll go through how to sign your first transaction using Metamask.

The first step is to open up the Metamask browser extension and login. If you're using Chrome you should be able to do this by clicking on the fox icon located to the right of your address bar.

If you can't see it, [click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/metamask). This will open up an interface to your Ethereum wallet. Set up your wallet as described [here](./).

On metamask wallet select the network and the account you want to use. Access to your Dao, connect your metamask wallet and interact to the Dao with an action.&#x20;

In the following example, we will add a new token and we will show how to sign the transaction for finalizing this. If you need help on "How to add tokens to your Dao" please go [here](../aragon-client/explore-template-dao/what-are-apps/token-app.md).&#x20;

After filling in all the requested fields in the _Add tokens_ page and clicking the _Create transaction_ button, it opens a metamask popup (as shown in the image) that ask to sign the transaction with the _Confirm_ button. Confirm and that's it. The transaction is gone. :tada:
