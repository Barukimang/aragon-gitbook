# Sign a transaction with MetaMask

{% hint style="info" %}
Important info: In this section, we'll go through how to sign your first transaction in your DAO using Metamask.
{% endhint %}

The first step is to open up the Metamask browser extension and login. If you're using Chrome you should be able to do this by clicking on the fox icon located to the right of your address bar.

If you can't see it, [click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/metamask). This will open up an interface to your Ethereum wallet. Set up your wallet as described [here](./).

> In the following example, we will _add a new token_ in the _Token_ App in our DAO and we will show how to sign the transaction for finalizing this.

1. On metamask wallet select the network and the account you want to use
2. Access your Dao (if you haven't one go [here](../aragon-client/how-to-create-a-dao-using-aragon-client/) to deploy your first DAO)
3. Connect your metamask wallet.&#x20;
4. _Click Add a new token_ in the _Token_ App (if you need help on "How to add tokens to your Dao" please go [here](../aragon-client/explore-template-dao/what-are-apps/token-app.md))&#x20;
5. After filling in all the requested fields in the _Add tokens_ page&#x20;
6. Click the _Create transaction_ button,&#x20;
7. It opens a metamask popup (as shown in the image) that ask to sign the transaction with the _Confirm_ button.&#x20;
8. Confirm and that's it.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
The transaction is gone. :tada:
