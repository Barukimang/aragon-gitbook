Please use these specs for filling in the fields:

* to: is the destination address
* amount: needs to be in wei (not in Ether), you can use a converter such as [https://eth-converter.com/](https://eth-converter.com) (for example: so instead of 200.0 for your amount you need to input 200000000000000000000)
* context should be 0x (without " " ) or any other hex byte you wish.
