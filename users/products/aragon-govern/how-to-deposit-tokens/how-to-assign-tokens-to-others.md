Insert the following fields:

Back on the _New transaction_ page fill the following fields in the _mint_ box:

_To_ - insert the address where the new to mint DAO tokens should be transferred.

_Amount_ - needs to be in wei (not in Ether), you can use a converter such as [https://eth-converter.com/](https://eth-converter.com) (for example: so instead of 200.0 for your amount you need to input 200000000000000000000).

_Context_ - should be 0x (without " ") or any other hex byte you wish.

Click _Schedule_ to execute the transaction.
