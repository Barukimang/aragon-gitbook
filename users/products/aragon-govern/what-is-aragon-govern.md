# What is Aragon Govern?

**Aragon Govern** is a DAO framework that relies on optimistic governance, empowering digital groups to operate in a frictionless governance model with on-chain execution and easy-to-use dispute resolution.

Instead of requiring your community to vote on every single proposal, with Aragon Govern, your DAO operates by **continuously executing actions unless these are challenged**. Challenged actions are all safeguarded by [Aragon Court](../aragon-court/), a subjective dispute resolution system.
