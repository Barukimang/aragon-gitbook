# What is Aragon Govern?

Aragon Govern v2 is a next-generation solution for **building DAOs**. It was designed to provide even greater freedom of action, yet take a fraction of the time to deploy. It ties in nicely with Aragon Voice and has extremely low gas fees. It requires some technical background, yet has considerable potential.&#x20;

Aragon Govern is a **DAO framework** that relies on **optimistic governance**, empowering digital groups to operate in a frictionless governance model with on-chain execution and easy-to-use dispute resolution.

Instead of requiring your community to vote on every single proposal, with Aragon Govern your DAO operates by **continuously executing actions unless these are challenged**. Challenged actions are all safeguarded by [Aragon Court](../aragon-court/), a subjective dispute resolution system.
