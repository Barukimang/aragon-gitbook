# Why do transactions require a delay period in order to be executed?

An Aragon Govern DAO works with the principle that participants interacting with it are acting in the best interest of the respective community. In other words, it assumes that any scheduled transactions will respect the DAO agreement, and therefore will be permitted by the community.

To counter and prevent bad actors from executing non-conform actions, all transactions come with a _cool-off_ period, allowing all community members to review it before it can be executed. This is what is called the delay period on Aragon Govern DAOs.

Thanks to the delay period, the community has the opportunity to challenge any to-be-executed transaction, ensuring an extra layer of security.&#x20;
