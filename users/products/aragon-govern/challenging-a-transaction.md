# Challenging a transaction

With Aragon Govern's **optimistic governance model**, every transaction has a **delay period** (you can read more [here](why-do-transactions-require-a-delay-period-in-order-to-be-executed.md)) allowing the community to review these and decide if these contain any malicious actions non-conform to the DAO agreement.

When this happens, **transactions can be challenged**, and a dispute is created in Aragon Court (or any other preferred dispute resolution system specified in the DAO).

If you do not agree with a transaction that has been scheduled, provide a clear justification so that guardians can understand why you are disputing it. This will greatly increase case comprehension for the guardians and can allow for fast dispute resolution.

**IMPORTANT**

* When you challenge a transaction, you need to add collateral to the challenge. The collateral token and amount are defined in the DAO settings.
* When creating a dispute, you also need to pay the court fees (in DAI), which will be used to pay guardians and actors on the dispute.&#x20;
