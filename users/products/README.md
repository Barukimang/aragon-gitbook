How does Aragon fit in? Aragon provides you with tools (apps) that make it easy for you to create DAOs -- you can think of Aragon apps as lego bricks that can be flexibly combined to make DAOs (the final lego structures).

The Aragon solutions are **decentralized apps (dApp)** on the Ethereum blockchain that enable anyone to **create and manage autonomous decentralized organizations** such as clubs, companies, gaming guilds, cooperatives, nonprofits, open-source projects, and any other type of organization you can imagine.&#x20;

Aragon currently supports creating organizations on the main [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) network (“mainnet”), [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com), [Harmony](https://explorer.harmony.one) and [Andromeda](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io) network and the [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/#stats) test network (“testnet”),[ Mumbai,](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com) [BSC Testnet](https://testnet.bscscan.com), Stardust and [Harmony Testnet](https://explorer.testnet.harmony.one).
