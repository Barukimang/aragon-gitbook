# Creating a voting proposal

Although proposals are not yet formally integrated into DAOs and there is no guarantee of participation, Aragon Voice is **free to use**, meaning that no-one is priced out of participation. Also full transparency removes any doubt about the integrity of the ballot, meaning that communities are more likely to view ballots as unbiased and run fairly.

With Aragon Voice, even the most humble token holder will be empowered to **make a proposal** such as changing the exchange fee on a Balancer Pool and directly contributing to the development of their favorite project.

## To create a proposal go here: [https://voice.aragon.org/](https://voice.aragon.org) and connect your web3 wallet
