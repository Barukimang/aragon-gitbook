# How to create a proposal

Although proposals are not yet formally integrated into DAOs and there is no guarantee of participation, Aragon Voice is free to use, meaning that no-one is priced out of participation, and full transparency removes any doubt about the integrity of the ballot, meaning that communities are more likely to view ballots as unbiased and fairly run.

With Aragon Voice, even the most humble token holder will be empowered to make a proposal such as changing the exchange fee on a Balancer Pool and directly contributing to the development of their favorite project.

For creating a proposal go here [https://voice.aragon.org/](https://voice.aragon.org) and connect your web3 wallet (if you need help go [here](../set-up-metamask/)). Please select the Ethereum network on your wallet.&#x20;

Select the type of the new proposal:

* **signalling proposal**: gasless proposal creation using Vochain layer 2 solution
* **on-chain proposal**: metadata is stored on Ethereum, increasing decentralization and verifiability

Fill in all the fields in the new proposal:

* Title: insert a title of your proposal
* Description: a description of what is your proposal about
* The proposal date: during this period the vote is open
* Question: a short description of what the vote is about
* Description: a description of what the vote is about
* Add question: if your proposal has more than one vote
* Click _create proposal_ and approve the transaction on your wallet&#x20;
