# How to create a proposal

Although proposals are not yet formally integrated into DAOs and there is no guarantee of participation, Aragon Voice is free to use, meaning that no-one is priced out of participation, and full transparency removes any doubt about the integrity of the ballot, meaning that communities are more likely to view ballots as unbiased and fairly run.

With Aragon Voice, even the most humble token holder will be empowered to make a proposal such as changing the exchange fee on a Balancer Pool and directly contribute to the development of their favorite project.
