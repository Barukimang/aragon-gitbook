2400

### **What date will the lock-up period end?**

The 5th of October, 2021.

### **When will the contracts for the conversion be available?**

These are currently being worked on and will be available by July 2021.

### **If I have not staked my $ANJ, do I still get the lockup period price?**

When you convert your $ANJ, the resulting $ANT is automatically staked into Aragon Court v2 and locked until the 5th of October. If you have $ANJ staked in the Aragon Court v1, you will first need to [unstake it](https://v1.court.aragon.org) and send it to your wallet before you can do the conversion.

### **Will I get the 0.044 conversion if I convert after September 5th?**

No, to get the 0.044 staked price you will need to have staked your $ANJ before 23:59 on September the 4th (UTC).

### **How much will it cost to be a Guardian in Aragon Court with $ANT?**

You will have to stake 100 $ANT to become an Aragon Court Guardian.
