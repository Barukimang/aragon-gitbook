### **I can't see my tokens in the Dashboard**

Please try the following steps:

1. Make sure that your account is [connected to the Dashboard](https://help.aragon.org/article/42-aragon-court-dashboard#connecting-to-dashboard).
2. If you own multiple accounts, make sure that the right account is selected.
3. Make sure that you are connected to the Ethereum mainnet network.
4. Refresh your browser's page.

### **I activated my tokens but I can't see my probability of being drafted**

When tokens are activated, you must wait until the current term is over for them to increase your probability of being drafted. You can see the current term and its remaining duration at the top of the Dashboard.

### My wallet (with the ANJ or ANT v1) isn't available on the wallets list on the Aragon Portal. How can I convert my tokens?

If your wallet isn't available in the list of wallets on the Aragon Portal, you can choose a wallet on the list proposed on the Aragon Portal, you can create a new account and move the tokens from your wallet to the new wallet. Then proceed with the swap on the portal. Alternately you can import your seed into the new wallet, connect the new wallet to the portal and proceed with the swap.
