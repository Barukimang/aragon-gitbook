# Is Vocdoni anonymous?

Right now it is anonymous to anyone auditing the process, Even though the entity's administrator may be able to identify voters.

In Q3 2021, we will release a new version of our voting protocol that makes use of advances cryptographic mechanisms called zk-SNARKs to achieve full anonymity.

If you want to know more about these cryptographic mechanisms you can check out our technical documentation [here](https://docs.vocdoni.io).
