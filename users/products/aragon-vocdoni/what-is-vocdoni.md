# Abaout Aragon Vocdoni

**Vocdoni** is a project inside of the Aragon ecosystem, which is aimed at developing secure **digital voting and governance solutions** using decentralized technologies.

The main product is the eponymous **governance platform**, which allows participation in conventional organizations with the maximum guarantees of security and privacy. The platform is formed by a set of tools that not only serves for **digital voting** but also covers all other management aspects of an organization, such as **membership management**, dues **payments** and **fundraising**, as well as **verifiable communication**.

The **voting protocol** that powers the platform is designed to be **universally verifiable, secure, and resistant** to attack and censorship through the use of blockchain technology, together with decentralized technologies and cryptographic mechanisms, such as zero-knowledge proofs.
