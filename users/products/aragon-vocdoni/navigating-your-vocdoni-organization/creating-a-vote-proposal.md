### Who can Vote Page

On the _Who can Vote_ page can:

* _**Select the voting options**_**:** _normal_ (where all the voters have the same voting power) and _weighted_ (where each voter has different voting power)
* _**Import the list of voters**_**:** only the voters on the list can vote on the voting process. For creating the list of voters you can download the available template (_Download template_ button), adjust the fields (you can add for example the National Id) and then drag and drop the file (csv, xlsx, ods formats are supported).
