# Aragon Values, Finances, and Legal

#### Aragon is governed by our [manifesto](https://aragon.org/manifesto) - a living document developed in the community and evolving with time.

### Mission and Vision

Aragon is a community-driven project with the mission to **empower freedom** by creating tools for **decentralized governance** to thrive.

These tools help people freely organize **across borders** and **without intermediaries**. Instead of bureaucracy, subjectivity, and trust, the use of smart contracts has opened the door to **experiment with decentralized governance (at the speed of software)**.

### Our User

Organizations that can be spun up instantly, that can't be shut down by governments, that are resistant to internet censorship, and that allow small groups of people to collaborate effectively.

### The AN DAO

The Aragon Network DAO is a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized\_autonomous\_organization) that was established by the Aragon Association after a public vote of $ANT holders on the Aragon Network Charter[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Aragon\_\(organization\)#cite\_note-6)in October 2021. The AN DAO is intended to be the vehicle for the Aragon project after the dissolution of the Aragon Association.

Aragon takes care of the most important pieces of infrastructure to deliver censorship-resistant, decentralized and upgradeable apps.

#### The AN DAO Ecosystem

The Aragon Network DAO consists of a Main DAO and three satellite organizations: the Executive Sub-DAO, the Compliance Sub-DAO, and the Tech Committee. Each sub-DAO has a committee of three members, elected by a combination of a public vote and the Aragon Association. Each committee member has a tenure of one year and is paid 200 $ANT per month.

If you're new to this ecosystem, don't worry if some (or all) of that sounded a little abstract. You can think of Aragon as **providing the lego pieces** to allow people (like you) to build the **next generation of human organizations**.
