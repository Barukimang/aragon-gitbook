# The Package management

{% hint style="success" %}
The Package management = <mark style="color:purple;">**publishing and upgrading**</mark> Aragon apps.
{% endhint %}

## How does it work?

**To ease upgrades** for Aragon apps, both **app smart contracts and frontend** can be upgraded using **aragonPM**.

aragonPM is a DAO built on top of aragonOS (taking advantage of upgradeability and the ACL).

aragonPM allows for multiple package registries to exist with different governance models for package publishing and releasing new versions.&#x20;

There is an official Aragon curated aragonPM, `aragonpm.eth`, which has very strict restrictions of what gets published and very high-quality standards that we use for publishing our core components.

Different aragonPM registries in which everyone can publish their packages are expected to be created by the community. You can create your own registry and have full control over it.

You can read more about aragonPM [here](../aragonpm/).
