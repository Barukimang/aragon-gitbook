### What is the Web3? <a href="#web3" id="web3"></a>

Unless you've been living under a rock for the last few years, you've probably come across the term **web3** ðŸ˜‹.&#x20;

But what does it mean exactly? And why do we care about it in the context of Aragon?

Web3 is the vision of a fully **decentralized web**. One of the craziest things to wrap your head around is that in web3, apps don't need a central server to fetch data from!

How is this possible?&#x20;

In a nutshell, thanks to something called **peer-to-peer data architectures**. The key point is that in a P2P architecture, instead of requesting data from a central server, you request it from multiple computers (peers) around you.

While this is nothing new in itself -- P2P architectures have existed since the 1990â€™s (where they rose to fame with file sharing programs like BitTorrent and Napster) -- what's new is the addition of **cryptography and economic incentives** to these architectures.

The fusion of these seemingly disparate disciplines was the big innovation behind Bitcoin, and has since led to the emergence of a new field of research devoted to their intersection (what we now call cryptoeconomics).

While we won't get into the details here, the key takeaway:

{% hint style="success" %}
Cryptoeconomics is the big unlock that has allowed us to start moving from centralized data structures (web2) to more decentralized or fully distributed data architectures (web3).
{% endhint %}

> Note that thereâ€™s a spectrum from fully centralized (left) to fully decentralized (right).

And while blockchains -- like Bitcoin and Ethereum -- are key to this web3 vision, it's important to note that there are **other essential parts** of the web3 stack that are not covered by them.

For example, since blockchains are relatively expensive to **store data** on, it turns out that they don't make great file systems. That's why there's also a need for decentralized file systems like the **** [**IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**](https://ipfs.io) which Aragon also makes use of.
