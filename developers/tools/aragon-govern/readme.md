**üëã Get started contributing with a** [**good first issue**](https://github.com/aragon/govern/labels/good%20first%20issue%20%F0%9F%8C%9E)

Before explaining how you can contribute, It's worth mentioning that we use `develop` branch as the default one. This makes it easier for us to have all the latest, development changes without affecting the current production version. Though, We don't use `release` branches to make the process a little bit easier !

* Pushing to `develop` branch via PR deploys changes to testing environments(currently only rinkeby).
* Pushing to `master` branch via PR from `develop` deploys changes to production servers(mainnet).
* Pushing to `master|develop` directly will be restricted to make sure the PR's are reviewed.
* Creating PRs end up in relation to `develop` by default.

Don't be shy to contribute even the smallest tweak. Everyone will be especially nice and helpful to beginners to help you get started!

### Structure

This repo uses Lerna and yarn workspaces to bootstrap itself, and is divided into multiple independent sub-packages:

* [`erc3k`](broken-reference): Aragon's reference implementation of [ERC3000](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3000), the up and coming governance standard.
* [`Govern.js`](broken-reference): Govern's official JS wrapper for creating seamless DAO experiences.
* [`Govern Console`](broken-reference): No-frills, forkable, extensible power user / developer UI tool for interacting with and visualizing low level information about Govern DAOs. Available on [console.aragon.org](https://console.aragon.org).
* [`Govern Contract Utils`](broken-reference): Set of all libraries and utilities used by the core Govern contracts.
* [`Govern Core`](broken-reference): The core set of Aragon Govern contracts.
* [`Govern Create`](broken-reference): Set of templates used to create new Govern instances.
* [`Govern Discord`](https://github.com/aragon/govern/blob/master/packages/govern-discord/README.md): Govern-native Discord bot for DAOs.
* [`Govern Server`](broken-reference): Server powering Govern.js and the Govern API to enable Web2-like experiences for DAOs.
* [`Govern Subgraph`](broken-reference): Govern's official Subgraph, which tracks DAOs registered on the A1-deployed ERC3000Registry.
