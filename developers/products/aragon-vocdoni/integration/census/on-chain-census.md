# On-Chain Census

This is the census mechanism used by [Aragon Voice](https://voice.aragon.org)

[(opens new window)](https://voice.aragon.org)

[On-chain census](https://docs.vocdoni.io/architecture/census/on-chain.html) are defined as part of the Voting Protocol, so organizations using this method do not need to generate their own Census Merkle Tree. Rather, the Merkle Tree is an [Ethereum Storage Proof](https://docs.vocdoni.io/architecture/smart-contracts/storage-proofs.html) and the census is a weighted set of holders of a given Ethereum token.

On-chain census is more thoroughly documented at the [Census Overview](https://docs.vocdoni.io/architecture/census/census-overview.html) and Ethereum Storage Proof pages.
