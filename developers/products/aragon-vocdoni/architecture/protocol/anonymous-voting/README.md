# Anonymous voting

**Anonymous voting** is a type of voting process where the users can vote without revealing their identity, by proving that they are accepted as valid voters. Currently we have 2 types of _anonymous voting_ schemes:

* [Anonymous voting with **zk census proof**](https://docs.vocdoni.io/architecture/protocol/anonymous-voting/zk-census-proof): type of _anonymous voting_ where the user proves their ability to vote through a zk census proof (franchise proof).
* [Anonymous voting with **blind signatures**](https://docs.vocdoni.io/architecture/protocol/anonymous-voting/blind-signatures): type of _anonymous voting_ using blind signatures.
