## Manifesto

Aragon is governed by our [manifesto](https://aragon.org/manifesto) - a living document developed in the community and evolving with time.

## Mission

Aragon is a community-driven project with the mission to **empower freedom** by creating tools for **decentralized governance** to thrive.&#x20;

These tools help people to freely organize **across borders** and **without intermediaries**. Instead of bureaucracy, subjectivity, and trust, the use of smart contracts has opened the door to **experiment with decentralized governance (at the speed of software)**.

Aragon takes care of the most important pieces of infrastructure to deliver censorship-resistant, decentralized and upgradeable apps.

## Vision

Aragon is **providing the lego pieces** to allow people (like you) to build the **next generation of human organizations**.

## Our user

Organizations that can be spun up instantly, that can't be shut down by governments, that are resistant to internet censorship, and that allows small groups of people to collaborate effectively.&#x20;

If you're new to this ecosystem, don't worry if some (or all) of the above sounded a bit abstract. You can think of Aragon as **providing the lego pieces** to allow people (like you) to build the **next generation of human organizations**.
