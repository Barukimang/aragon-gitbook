# Communicating values

Clear communication is at the heart of Aragon, and various tools are used throughout the ecosystem to help connect the millions of people who have been engaged in some capacity.  Our expert community has spent thousands of hours collectively working to clarify and hone our vision and values - and here is a short list of ways for a newcomer to interface

DAOists - start or join a DAO

* Aragon Discord [#intros](https://discord.gg/ATbzCJRA) is a great place to start for introducing yourself [#biz-dev](https://discord.gg/TnkR229C) working group has specific connection tools for founders and executives
* [Aragon Governance Forum ](https://forum.aragon.org)- one way to learn about DAOs is to see the DAO for DAO software in action
* [Business development form ](https://forms.gle/tWfJa1tcsxyL7eV88?\_imcp=1)- fill this in to get support and review from the community
