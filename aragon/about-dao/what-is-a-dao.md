# What is a DAO?

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a **group of people** with **no central management** that coordinate over the internet around a **shared set of rules** to achieve a **common mission**.

A more accurate definition would be:

A DAO is an **internet-native entity** with **no central management** which is regulated by a set of automatically enforceable rules on a **public blockchain**, and whose goal is to take on a life of its own and incentivize people to achieve a shared common mission.

What exactly is a DAO? There are many ways to describe a DAO, and knowledgeable people may disagree on the precise definition. For our purposes, you can think of DAOs as **flexible, global**, and **uncensorable online organizations**.
