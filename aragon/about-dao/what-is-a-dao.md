# What is a DAO?

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a **group of people** **without central management** that coordinates over the internet around a **shared set of rules** to achieve a **common mission**.

Another more technical definition would be:

A DAO is an **internet-native entity** **without central management** which is regulated by a set of automatically enforceable rules on a **public blockchain**, and whose goal is to take on a life of its own and incentivize people to achieve a shared common mission.

But what exactly is a DAO? There are many ways to describe a DAO, and knowledgeable people may disagree on the precise definition. For our purposes, you can think of DAOs as **flexible, global**, and **uncensorable online organizations**.

#### **DAO use cases:**

* Part-time projects with friends or strangers
* Future of work: people working part-time on multiple things for short periods of time
* Temporary pop-up companies
* Companies in authoritarian jurisdictions
* Global, distributed teams

#### **Trends around the world accelerating DAO adoption:**

* The rise of populist authoritarians
* The future of work (remote and distributed)
* The growing de-platforming problem
* The rise of decentralized finance
* The [increasing](https://medium.com/complex-systems-channel/teams-a-manifesto-7490eab144fa) [complexity](https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile) of human civilization
