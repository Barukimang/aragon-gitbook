# Why do we need DAOs?

## **Problem statement**

Common corporate entities such as the Limited Liability Company (LLC) have served us for many decades. Only with the advent of the World Wide Web and the increased international cooperation that came alongside with it, nationally registered corporate entities seem more and more like relics from the past:

#### INCLUSIVITY

Corporate entities are registered on national level, and it is tedious (and costly) to set-up international corporate structures. Also they are often in-transparent, and it is bureaucratic to include new people into the entities.

#### MISSION

Corporate structures often tend to focus on making and maximising profits around a service they offer, and forgetting to look at the long-term social and environmental impact they create which is negative in many cases.&#x20;

#### OWNERSHIP

Most people in organisations are employees who dedicate a large part of their life to an organisation but never receive a (real) share of it, or get a real vote in it.

#### SECURITY

Except for finance departments and management, it is hard to know how exactly how many funds are available and how they are managed. This opens the door for mismanagement of funds and even to fraud and corruption.

#### SCALABILITY

Scaling to many different countries is difficult: due to the many different corporate rules in countries it is time-consuming and costly to create an international legal framework for an organization.



## **Problem solution: DAOs**

At Aragon, we believe that decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are the solution to this problem.

#### INCLUSIVITY

DAOs are an inclusive, transparent and global model for human coordination. There is no limitation on what a group of people can create a DAO or what the governance structure it must have.

#### MISSION

DAOs allow people to come together and work on common missions just as easy as joining a chat group. These missions often revolve around a long-term purpose with positive social and environmental impacts. Profit is secondary to this.

#### OWNERSHIP

DAOs incentivize contributors by giving compensating them with DAO-native-tokens which give them a real share and a real vote in the organization.

#### SECURITY

DAOs allow to securely manage shared funds with a transparent public ledger, where each participant can have a vote on what happens to the shared funds.

#### SCALABILITY

DAOs can scale rapidly and flawlessly on an international level, and are great for both open and closed communities.



### EXAMPLE

A good example of a DAO is [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org). This is a virtual world, where users own land and can make collective decisions on the future of the virtual world.&#x20;
