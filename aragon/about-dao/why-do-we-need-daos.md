# Why do we need DAOs?

> ## **Problem statement**
>
> Common corporate entities such as the Limited Liability Company (LLC) have served us for many decades. Only with the advent of the World Wide Web and the increased international cooperation that came alongside with it, nationally registered corporate entities seem more and more like relics from the past**.**

### Here are the following benefits that DAOs offer compared to hierarchical, traditional organizations.

## Scalability

&#x20;\=> Corporate entities are registered on a national level, and it is tedious (and costly) to set-up international corporate structures. Also they are often in-transparent, and it is bureaucratic to include new people into the entities.

> **Solution:** DAOs are able to operate globally, in any time zone without the neccessity to over-complicate bureaucratic processes thanks to transparent and collective work culture.

## Accountability

\=> Corporate structures often tend to focus on making and maximising profits around a service they offer, and forgetting to look at the long-term social and environmental impact they create which is negative in many cases.&#x20;

> **Solution:** DAOs allow people to come together and work on common missions just as easy as joining a chat group. These missions often revolve around a long-term purpose with positive social and environmental impacts

## Ownership

\=> Most people in organisations are employees who dedicate a large part of their life to an organisation but never receive a (real) share of it, or get a real vote in it.

> **Solution:** DAOs are driven by democracy and completely remove the principal-agent based system from the organization. DAO-native-tokens give them the share and the voting power.

## Security

\=> Except for finance departments and management, it is hard to know how exactly how many funds are available and how they are managed. This opens the door for mismanagement of funds and even to fraud and corruption.

> **Solution:** In DAOs the community decides how the funds are distributed which is operated in an anonymous but also transparent way thanks to tools such as crypto wallets.



## Governance in DAOs

Here you will find a comparison between the way DAOs and traditional organisations deal with governing processes.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Voting required by members for any changes to be implemented.                      | Depending on structure, changes can be demanded from a sole party, or voting may be offered.     |
| Votes tallied, and outcome implemented automatically without trusted intermediary. | If voting allowed, votes are tallied internally, and outcome of voting must be handled manually. |
| All activity is transparent and fully public.                                      | Activity is typically private, and limited to the public.                                        |

## Use Case

A good example of a DAO is [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org). This is a virtual world, where users own land and can make collective decisions on the future of the virtual world.&#x20;
