# Why do we need DAOs?

## **Problem statement**

Many of us have gone through the pain of setting up a corporate entity. Or felt like we've lacked the tools to collaborate with people all around the globe when we're building stuff we want to see in the world.

**Right now, the current system simply doesn't work.** If you want to set up an organisation you have to go to lawyers, pay thousands of dollars, and all you get in return is a set of unintelligible pieces of paper that cost you more than months of development.

On top of this, these pieces of paper don't enforce anything by themselves: they're more like an idea or a concept.

If you try to explain this to a kid, you quickly realize how mad the current system seems to them. When you think about it, it's really impressive that the world functions the way it does with this sort of legacy framework and operating system underneath.

## **Problem solution: DAOs**

At Aragon, we believe that decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are the solution to this problem.

#### INCLUSIVITY

DAOs are an inclusive, transparent and global model for human coordination. There is no limitation on what group of people can create a DAO or what the governance structure it must have.

#### UNITY

DAOs allow people to come together and work on common missions just as easy as joining a chat group.&#x20;

#### MOTIVATION

They incentivize contributors by giving them a say in the future of the organization.&#x20;

#### SECURTY

They allow to securely manage shared funds, where each participant can have a vote on what happens to them.

#### SCALABILITY

They can scale rapidly and are great for both open and closed communities.

### EXAMPLE

A good example of a DAO is [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org). This is a virtual world, where users own land and can make collective decisions on the future of the virtual world.&#x20;
