# What is decentralized autonomous governance?

Every centralized organization is controlled by an individual or a small group. They serve as a trusted middleman and ideally would act in the name of the shared interest. Yet most would only care about personal interest, which in that case would be 'a single point of failure'.&#x20;

Decentralized governance is here to fix the 'single point of failure' issue. Just like digital currencies revolutionised finance, it will do the same to governance. **Abolishing central authority**, the community looks after the organization. Only if the majority (how exactly this is to be calculated is decided per use case) agrees with an action, it will be enforced.

Decentralized governance also reduces bureaucracy and speeds up innovation. No more single points of failure!
