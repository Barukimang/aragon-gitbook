# Why use Aragon to build a DAO?

Aragon is the major player in building DAOs on **Ethereum and other blockchains**. Most of the DAOs currently operational are either built directly on Aragon or have forked Aragon source code.&#x20;

As Aragon is largely community-driven, our users always have a say on how the platform evolves. Aragon is transparent. You can talk to developers in Discord or on our forum and ask any outstanding questions.

Finally, Aragon offers friendly guides on how to build DAOs and a welcoming community that will help you out with advice. And if you are not confident, you can always hire an Aragon Expert, that will tailor a DAO to best fit your needs.
