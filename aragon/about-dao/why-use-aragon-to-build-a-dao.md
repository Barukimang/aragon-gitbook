# Why use Aragon to build a DAO?

### Aragon is the major player in building DAOs&#x20;

With Aragon you can have your DAO on **Ethereum or other blockchains**. Most of the DAOs currently operational are either built directly on Aragon or have forked Aragon source code.&#x20;

### **Aragon is largely community-driven**

Our users always have a say on how the platform evolves. Aragon is transparent. You can talk to developers in Discord or on our forum and ask any question.

### **Aragon offers user-friendly guides**&#x20;

We provide information about how to build DAOs and a welcoming community that will help you out with advice. And if you are not confident, you can always hire an Aragon Expert, that will tailor a DAO to best fit your needs.
